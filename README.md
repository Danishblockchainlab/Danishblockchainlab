- üëã Hi, we're @Danishblockchainlab, an an award-winning security company that specializes in blockchain security from
a holistic point of view. 
- üß† What we do: 
We analyse and security test the system architecture surrounding the blockchain setup and ensure that it is adequately secure. Our team of white hat crackers tests and analyse this by reverse engineering and
we focus on the implementations and system integrations. It‚Äôs about thinking like the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù, to prevent them from pickpocketing and exploiting the architecture
and misconfigurations.

We aspire to help your company reach its maximum security potential. Danish Blockchain Lab is your
one-stop solution for blockchain security analysis, blockchain development, and secure integration. We
have developed a methodology unlike any others, which is why we've won two awards from EU Business
News as "Emerging Cyber Security Firm of the Year 2022" and "Innovation Award for Blockchain Security
Analysis 2022". We believe that unity between academic research and consultants with years of practical
experience is the way of succeeding in a rapidly moving digital world.

Our team consists of the trinity between:
‚Ä¢ Highly qualified reverse engineers
‚Ä¢ Cryptographic researcher from the highest-ranking universities.
‚Ä¢ World-leading architects.

This trinity ensures that your project receives the best possible assistance with our blockchain security
consulting services.

- üå± Our audit process: 
Danish Blockchain Lab‚Äôs award-winning audit contains everything a full security audit
should.

‚Ä¢ Detailed information on the audit with an actionable description of any issues found, based on best practices within the industry and our world-class white hat hackers‚Äô practical experience.
‚Ä¢ An outline of potential exploitable vulnerabilities in the code and any unexpected behaviour caused by errors in the architecture and/or logic, and additional recommendations to increase
security, and a general analysis of the contract and architecture surrounding it.
‚Ä¢ Dynamics reflecting state-of-the-art security patterns.
‚Ä¢ A classification of issues according to severity with proposed, concrete fixes.
‚Ä¢ A review of any fixes to issues identified in the audit process.
‚Ä¢ Tokenomics / game theory / math conducted by world-class researchers to ensure that there are no exploits related to the token.
‚Ä¢ An analysis of whether the contracts implement the behaviour described in the documentation/specifications.
‚Ä¢ Only protocol-specific experts will be used in the audit process.

The process itself is outlined below, for total clarity and transparency.

We start with a manual review of the code; does it have in-line documentation, are the test cases
rigorous enough (if there are any), are there any references to other code libraries/repositories/
assembly code etc. If there are references, we also check these to ensure that all of the code is secure,
and not just parts of it. This is where we move into the architectural review. We assess the entire
environment around the smart contracts, to make sure there are no leaked info such as seed phrases,
important wallet addresses etc. and we make sure that it's efficient code as well, so it allows for
scalability. Op top, we also analyse the integrations with other chains, as this is accounting for 69% of
all hacks in 2022 as of August.

Once we're done with the architecture and smart contracts, we look into tokenomics; can the math be
exploited to mine all the tokens at once, to overtake a DAO through voting rights, to rig a chance-based
outcome, to borrow without collateral and so on.

Besides of the audit, we also offer the following services as extra layers of security:
‚Ä¢ Continuous security monitoring and intelligence services (Domain/Threat).
‚Ä¢ A response team ready to take action in case an attack should take place, despite the precautions.
